      <h2>PAIN ERASING DYNAMIC LIFT</h2> 
      <p class="block-text2">Seamless, built-in, belly support band provides powerful abdominal
lift and support, redistributing baby weight to ease common pregnancy pains. Wrapping 360&deg; around the body, placed low on the belly and connecting to X-shaped upper back support, the belly compression band decreases pressure on the pelvic floor, delivers welcome relief from abdominal and round ligament pain and reduces stress on the lower back. This pain-reducing miracle worker will shift your focus from irritating aches to flutters and kicks.</p>

      <h2>SWEET RELIEF FOR <br class="mobile-only">ACHING BACKS</h2> 
      <p class="block-text2">We know how hard pregnancy can be on your body and back pain is one of the most common pregnancy complaints. So we engineered innovative X-shaped back support to strengthen and brace the upper back, minimize stress on the lower back and abdominals and reduce sciatic nerve pain. As your center of gravity shifts, reinforced 4-way back support also encourages better posture helping you stand straighter and feel more motivated to take on the day.</p>

      <h2>DESIGNED WITH YOUR <br class="mobile-only">BODY IN MIND</h2> 
      <p class="block-text2">Graduated degrees of compression, united with the belly support band create a knit-in anchor to reinforce lift and redistribute weight. Technically tailored, the ergonomic compression zones, precisely follow the contours of the pregnant body so you'll feel support where you need it with plenty of freedom for your growing bub. Pains and strains are a thing of the past, and the best part? Our compression panels have a contouring effect to round and smooth out extra lumps for a picture-perfect baby bump.</p>
